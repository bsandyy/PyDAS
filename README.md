PyDAS
=====
Python Data Acquisition Service

**Under heavy development**

## TODOs:
1. Add Swagger to service.
1. Service test should only call the service through a Bravado generated client.
1. Add manifest.yml.
1. Command starting in tests should be taken from manifest.
1. Add bumpversion and versioning.
1. Make it run on Travis.
1. Make talons.auth middleware implement Falcon middleware, because this is confusing
